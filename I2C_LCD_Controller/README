Description
----------------
In this program, the microcontroller acts as the I2C slave. It
receives some text from a master which it then outputs this text to
the attached LCD. It can also handle requests to get data from the LCD
EEPROM. The goal here is to reduce the large number of connections
required to connect to an LCD, to just the two required for I2C.
